# Particles
This is a visual representation of an N-body simulation. This project will demonstrate how celestial bodies interact with each other when under the influence of gravity. This project incorporates realistic physics in order to make the simulation as accurate as possible.

## How To Use & Installation
The project can be installed via the link on my website:

http://www.alexeyelkin.com

In order to run the project, it must be extracted from its **rar** format. This can be done with **WinRar** Software. 

## Controls

**M** - Show Mesh

**SPACE** - Pause

**Left Mouse Click** - Generate Particle

**Right Mouse Click + drag** - Generate Particle with an initial velocity

**SCROLL** - Change the initial size of the generated particle.

## Physics Explained
### The Following Formulae are used in the simulation:

 *The Image above shows particles converging to the center of the screen. In This simulation, the particles started in a random arrangement from 0px - 1080px in a square of dimensions 1080 x 1080px in which they were evenly spread out. This meant that the overall center of gravity was approximately in the center of the screen. During the course of this simulation, the particles converged to the center of the screen and merged, until only one very large stationary particle was remaining.*
